# Statistical-Analysis-of-Patient-Satisfaction-with-Clinician-at-Group-Health

The purpose of the project is to utilize statistical analysis in Microsoft Excel and Tableau to recognize trends among the GroupHealth patient satisfaction survey data as a method to supply recommendations in order to improve clinician performance and ensure excellence in Group Health’s individualized physician-patient care experience.
Specifically, Group Health’s patient satisfaction surveys focused on the patient’s satisfaction with the clinician (clinician satisfaction) was used a measuring tool to translate improvement categories and ratings of the clinician into meaningful, quantifiable, and actionable data. Finally, next steps of quality improvement can be implemented in the results of the analysis.

Statistical tests included in this project are:
1. Provide literature review of the assigned topic.
2.  Calculate descriptive statistics using Excel and interpret. 
3.  Graph different measures from class data set. Develop a series of hypotheses based on class data set 
to be tested in later weeks.
4.  Calculate z-scores, standard errors, and confidence intervals.
5.  Interpret the results.
6. Create Tableau data file and worksheets.
7. Calculate standard errors, and confidence intervals.
8. Calculate t-tests, f-tests, z-tests, perform one-way ANOVA. Tukey test
9.  Calculate non-parametric statistics.
10.  Calculate Chi-Square statistics.
11.  Interpret the results.
